            In this presentation, you will discover that although a brand’s reputation is typically built over several
            decades of its history, this is not always the case. For instance, Breitling is often recognized as a brand
            specializing in instruments designed specifically for aviation professionals. This image has indeed been the
            one we aimed to project so far, especially since the quartz crisis, which marked a pivotal moment in the
            brand’s evolution.
            The History module offers a comprehensive exploration of the brand and its diverse worlds throughout time.
            We will examine the brand’s story in broad strokes to help you understand the foundations and legitimacy of
            our current positioning, while also providing you with the knowledge to strengthen your sales pitch and
            better connect with customers.
            The journey began in 1884 with the founding of the brand by Léon Breitling, whose ambition was to create the
            most precise and reliable time measurement instruments available. This legacy of innovation and quality has
            been preserved and built upon for more than a century, continuing to this day.
            This section highlights the key figures who played a crucial role in making Breitling one of the most iconic
            and respected watch brands worldwide. The three generations of the founding family—Léon, Gaston, and
            Willy—shared a common mission: to develop the world’s finest chronograph. Their dedication and passion laid
            the groundwork for the brand’s enduring success and prestigious reputation in the watchmaking industry.
